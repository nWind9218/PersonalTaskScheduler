Makefile:  Go doesn't have a single file exactly like package.json for defining scripts. However, the common
  and idiomatic way to achieve similar functionality in Go projects is to use a Makefile.
  A Makefile allows you to define a set of tasks or commands that you can run with the make command.
  For example, you could have make run to run your application, make build to build it, and make test        
  to run your tests.
